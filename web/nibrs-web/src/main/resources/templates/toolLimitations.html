				<p>There are some NIBRS rules that the NIBRS PCT cannot enforce because the validation relies on access to previously submitted incidents or specific FBI information on the submitting agency. There are other differences between the NIBRS PCT Report and FBI Error Data Set (EDS) due to different interpretations of the rules. These are being addressed with the FBI and the NIBRS PCT will be updated to be consistent with the FBI Report. </p>
