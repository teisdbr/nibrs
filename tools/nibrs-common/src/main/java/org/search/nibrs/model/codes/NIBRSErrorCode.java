In this case, Data Element 3 (Incident Date/Hour) may be earlier than September 1999, but Data Element 5 (Exceptional Clearance Date) must be within September 1999.

Thereafter, all data coming from this agency must have dates subsequent to the initial start date of September 1999, except as mentioned previously.
